# __ISHLIB_NAME__ __ISHLIB_VERSION__

This is a collection of various scripts and tricks collected along the years.

The script is meant to be sourced elsewhere, but can be invoked as
`./ishlib.sh -h` flag to show the same documentation as below. The source
files in `./src` need not be manually used, they are already in `ishlib.sh`.

The documentation contains references to original sources where available,
but in practice this has been accumulated along the years, so many sources
are likely listed. Feel free to drop me a note if you notice some source or
acknowledgement that is missing.

## Known bugs and issues

- Documentation for `dry_run` is wrong.
